## Dependencies

Jarvis has several dependencies, some of which will require further setup:

- OpenAI: You will need to set your OpenAI key in the appsettings.json file and ensure you have non-expired credit in your OpenAI account. If you do not have an OpenAI key, see my [blog post](https://www.matthewyancer.com/2024/01/16/building-jarvis-in-csharp-part-1.html) for how to obtain one.
- eSpeak NG: You will need to install eSpeak NG for your operating system, see my [blog post](https://www.matthewyancer.com/2024/01/23/building-jarvis-in-csharp-part-2.html) for more info.
